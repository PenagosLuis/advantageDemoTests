Automation of Modules in advantagedemoshopping with Page Object Model (POM) in Cypress - November 2023
Greetings! My name is Luis Penagos, and I'm excited to share how I've implemented the automation of modules on the learning page www.advantageonlineshopping.com/ using the Page Object Model (POM) approach in Cypress.

About the Project
www.advantageonlineshopping.com/ is a learning platform for automation, designed for educational purposes. In this project, I've applied Cypress, an automated testing tool, to ensure the stability and reliability of critical modules of the application.

November 2023 Update
It's important to note that due to the ever-changing nature of www.advantageonlineshopping.com/, I've kept the automation up-to-date until November 2023. This involves adapting to constant modifications in the user interface and application logic.

Page Object Model (POM) Approach
The implementation is based on the POM pattern, which promotes a modular and maintainable structure for automation testing. Each page of the application has its own object file that encapsulates the specific elements and actions of that page.

Automation Examples
Below are some examples of automated actions using Cypress and POM:

javascript
Copy code
// Example of accessing the homepage
import HomePage from './pageObjects/HomePage';

describe('Testing advantagedemoshopping', () => {
  const homePage = new HomePage();

  it('Successfully log in', () => {
    homePage.visit();
    homePage.login('username', 'password');
    // Add validations as necessary
  });

  it('Add product to cart', () => {
    homePage.visit();
    homePage.searchProduct('productName');
    homePage.addToCart();
    // Add validations as necessary
  });
});
